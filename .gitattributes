# Default behavior for command prompt diff.
#

# This is need for earlier builds of msysgit that does not have it on by
# default for csharp files.
# Note: This is only used by command line

#
# Default behavior for project and solution files
#

# Merging from the command prompt will add diff markers to the files if there
# are conflicts (Merging from VS is not affected by the settings below, in VS
# the diff markers are never inserted). Diff markers may cause the following 
# file extensions to fail to load in VS. An alternative would be to treat
# these files as binary and thus will always conflict and require user
# intervention with every merge. To do so, just uncomment the entries below

*.sln          merge=binary
*.vgdbsettings merge=binary
*.csproj       merge=binary
*.vbproj       merge=binary

# Image files are treated as binary by default.

# Default behavior for common document formats
#

# Convert binary document formats to text before diffing them. This feature
# is only available from the command line. Turn it on by uncommenting the 
# entries below.
